<h2>Anime</h2>
<div class="info1">
<p>Anime refers to a specific style of cartoon produced or inspired by Japanese animation. Think of it this way: all anime shows are cartoons, but not all cartoons are anime. The art style associated with anime is very unique and recognizable.</p>

<h2>Computer Games</h2>
<div class="info1">
<p>Computer games or video games are an interactive digital medium consisting of several different genres of digital games. Games vary widely from the first video game Pong (introduced in 1974), which was essentially a low fidelity digital version of tennis. Since their introduction, computer games have multiplied rapidly and their fidelity has increased dramatically to the point at which some of the virtual environments modeled in games are startlingly realistic. Game genres include 1st person shooters, adventure games, racing games, role-playing games, puzzle games, strategy games, and simulation games, as well as countless hybrid combinations. There has been substantial research conducted on the negative effects of gaming such as addiction, carpal tunnel and as a contributing factor to ADD and ADHD. A majority of games lack any significant educational content.</p>
